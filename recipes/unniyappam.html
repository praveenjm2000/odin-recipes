    <h2>Preparation to make banana appam</h2>
    <p>1. First chop 100 to 105 grams jaggery. You should be able to get ½ cup chopped jaggery. You can also use jaggery powder, instead of chopped jaggery.</p>
    <p>2. Then add the jaggery in a bowl or pan containing 1.5 cups water.</p>
    <p>3. Keep the bowl or pan on low to medium flame and let the solution heat through. Stir so that the jaggery melts.</p>
    <p>4. You just need to melt the jaggery. When the jaggery melts, then filter the syrup and keep aside.</p>
    <p>5. Now chop a small piece of coconut in small bits. You will need about ¼ cup chopped coconut. You can even use grated coconut or you can skip coconut altogether.</p>
    <h2>Making banana appam batter</h2>
    <p>6. Heat 2 teaspoons ghee in a pan.</p>
    <p>7. Then add the chopped coconut.</p>
    <p>8. Stir often and saute them till they are light golden. Keep aside.</p>
    <p>9. In a pan peel and chop 3 small to medium bananas. About 250 grams bananas.</p>
    <p>10. Mash the bananas with a fork or masher very well.</p>
    <p>11. There should be no chunks in the bananas. You can even puree the bananas in a mixie or blender.</p>
    <p>12. Now add ½ tsp cardamom powder, ½ tsp ginger powder and ¼ tsp cumin powder. Ginger powder and cumin powder are optional and can be skipped, if you do not have them.</p>
    <p>13. Mix very well.</p>
    <p>14. To the bowl containing the jaggery solution, add 1.5 cups rice flour.</p>
    <p>15. Add 2 teaspoons black sesame seeds. You can also use white sesame seeds.</p>
    <p>16. Begin to mix very well.</p>
    <p>17. Make to a smooth batter without any lumps.</p>
    <p>18. Add the pureed bananas to the rice flour mixture.</p>
    <p>19. Add the coconut.</p>
    <p>20. Add ½ teaspoon baking soda. Baking soda makes the texture more porous and soft. If you want you can skip too.</p>
    <p>21. Mix very well.</p>
    <h2>Cooking the banana appam</h2>
    <p>22. Heat an appe pan and add ½ to 1 teaspoon ghee in each mould. Instead of ghee you can use coconut oil too.</p>
    <p>23. With a spoon, pour the batter till ¾ or more than ¾ in each mould.</p>
    <p>24. Keep the flame to low or medium and cook the banana appam.</p>
    <p>25. With a wooden/bamboo stick or skewer, turn over the banana appam which has become golden.</p>
    <p>26. When the rest of the banana appam are golden, turn them over too and cook all of them till crisp and golden.</p>
    <p>27. Once done remove and place them in a casserole. In the casserole, they stay warm for some time. Same way prepare the remaining banana appam. The recipe makes for 42 banana appam. You can store them in an air-tight box or container in the fridge.</p>
    <p>28. <strong>Serve them</strong> <strong>Hot or warm</strong> or at room temperature.</p>
