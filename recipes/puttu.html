    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Rice flour roased</li>
        <li>Coconut</li>
        <li>Water, Salt</li>
        <li>Puttu kudam</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>How to make puttu recipe</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Take 1 cup puttu flour in a mixing bowl or a pan.</li>
        <li>Add ⅓ teaspoon salt or as required.</li>
        <li>Mix very well</li>
        <li>Now sprinkle ⅓ cup water all over. The amount of water required will depend on the quality of rice flour. So you can add accordingly.</li>
        <li>Begin to mix the rice flour with the water with your fingertips.</li>
        <li>Mix very well</li>
        <li><strong>To get soft puttu</strong>, the amount of rice flour to water ratio is important. To check this gently press a small portion of the flour between your palms. It should form a lump. When you press this flour lump more, then it breaks and crumbles. This should be the texture of the flour.</li>
        <li>Break all the tiny lumps in the flour with your fingertips. You can even grind this rice flour mixture in a grinder to break lumps. But grind in small batches and use the pulse option of mixer-grinder.</li>
        <li>Now pour 2 to 3 cups water in the base vessel of the puttu kudam. Keep on stove top and let it get heated.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile first place the perforated disc inside the cylindrical vessel. Then add 2 to 3 tablespoons fresh coconut in the cylindrical vessel of the puttu kudam and spread evenly.</li>
        <li>Then gently add the puttu flour till it reaches half of the cylindrical vessel.</li>
        <li>Then again layer with 2 to 3 tablespoons of grated coconut and spread evenly.</li>
        <li>Cover the top portion with 2 to 3 tablespoons of grated coconut and spread evenly. Cover the top with the lid.</li>
        <li>Place the cylindrical portion on top of the base vessel in which the water must have come to a boil.</li>
        <li>Steam puttu on medium flame till you see steam releasing from the top vent of the cylindrical vessel. Then switch off the flame. It took me about 9 minutes as I have used a large puttu maker. If using a medium sized puttu maker or regular puttu maker, the time will be about 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once cooled, using a wooden skewer or the stick that accompanied the puttu kudam, remove the steamed puttu.</li>
        <li><strong>Server hot puttu </strong>with kadala curry or veg stew or potato stew. It will also go well with South Indian chana masala. Also serve some bananas and pappadums by side.</li>
